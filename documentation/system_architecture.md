**Base Image Selection**: Alpine Linux-based images for minimal attack surface and reduced resource consumption.

**Layer Caching**: Optimized Dockerfile structure to maximize Docker layer caching and reduce build times.

**Security Scanning**: Automated container vulnerability scanning using tools like Snyk or Aqua Security.

**Example Dockerfile for Node.js Service**:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for Node.js microservice
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

FROM node:18-alpine AS production

# Create non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

WORKDIR /app

# Copy built application
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --chown=nodejs:nodejs . .

# Security hardening
RUN apk --no-cache add dumb-init
USER nodejs

EXPOSE 3000

ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
